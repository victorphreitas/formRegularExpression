# formRegularExpression
Point One = I made this form using <input type="text"> and regular expressions to avoid wrong phone numbers, emails, names and zipcode.
Point Two = There is a blur event in it. So whenever you change the input you are writting it triggers the functions that hold the regular expressions.
